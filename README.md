A customized Oblique Plane Microscope (OPM) based on the design of SCPAE 2.0 published by Prof. Hillman. The microscope is primarily customized to image non-cleared brain organoids during the early development stage for quality control purposes.
The repository is currently work in progress and will eventually contain all information (alignment procedure, part list, 3D printing file, controlling code) need to re-build the same setup.
