# LSFM_Moraes-Lab
A customized Oblique Plane Microscope (OPM) based on the design of SCPAE 2.0 published by Prof. Hillman. The microscope is primarily customized to image non-cleared brain organoids during the early development stage for quality control purposes.

The repository is currently work in progress and will eventually contain all information (alignment procedure, part list, design files for machined items, controlling code) need to re-build the same setup.

It is also highly suggested for anyone new to light-sheet microscopy to consult Alfred Millett-Sikking's work(https://github.com/amsikking). The setup shown in this repository had received tremendous amount of help form Alfred and many design is also inspired by his work.
